## Overview...
In today’s fast-paced technological landscape, businesses and organizations require flexible and adaptable software systems that are able to respond dynamically to evolving demands of business and its customers. The crucial part of any modern software is a domain layer that encapsulates the business rules and data of a target system into a set of entities and interrelations among them. However, only models are often insufficient to express all types of enterprise requirements, especially if they emerge in real-time and systems must adjust dynamically while still remaining available.

The highlight of this work is a framework that permits the intuitive and effective formulation of constraints on a domain layer and their validation at runtime. In addition, the dynamic nature of adaptive models is also taken into account. Therefore, the constraint space is kept up-todate by employing the mechanisms like constraint synchronization and backward links. The framework’s design is modular and extensible, allowing easy integration within existing software systems.
