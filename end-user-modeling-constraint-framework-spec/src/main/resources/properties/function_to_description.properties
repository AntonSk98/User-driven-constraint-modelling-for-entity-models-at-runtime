AND=Logical AND function returns true if all its arguments evaluate to true and returns false if one or more arguments evaluate to false. Subsequently, this function accepts a list of nested functions that return a boolean value. Please note that providing at least two nested functions is required!
OR=The logical OR function returns true if at least one of its arguments evaluates to true. Otherwise, the function returns false. Subsequently, this function accepts a list of nested functions that return a boolean value. Please note that providing at least two nested functions is required!
MIN_LENGTH=This function defines the minimum number of characters an attribute must have.The respective argument must be provided as a decimal value.
MAX_LENGTH=This function defines the maximum number of characters an attribute must have. The respective argument must be provided as a decimal value.
FOR_ALL=This function performs the correct evaluation of a given constraint function for every instance element resulting from navigation.
FOR_SOME=This function performs the correct evaluation of a given constraint function for at least one instance element resulting from navigation.
FOR_NONE=This function performs the correct evaluation of a given constraint function for none of instance elements resulting from navigation.
FOR_EXACTLY=This function performs the correct evaluation of a given constraint function for exactly X instance elements resulting from navigation.
GREATER_THAN=This function returns true if the value of an instance element is greater than an input attribute
GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS=This function returns true if the value of an instance element is greater than or equals to an input attribute
LESS_THAN=This function returns true if the value of an instance element is less than an input attribute
LESS_THAN_OR_EQUALS=This function returns true if the value of an instance element is less than or equals to an input attribute
EQUALS=This function returns true if the value of an instance element is equal to a given attribute
UNIQUE=This function returns true if the whole constraint-space subgraph does not have an attribute with the same value
NOT_NULL_OR_EMPTY=Enforces that an attribute value must neither be null nor empty
MAX_CARDINALITY=Enforces that a target instance element can be associated with at most N elements of a given type
MIN_CARDINALITY=Enforces that a target instance element can be associated with at least N elements of a given type
IF_THEN=If a given condition is true, then evaluates the constraint
IF_THEN_ELSE=If a given condition is true, evaluates then clause, otherwise, evaluates else clause
